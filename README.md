# Armand Slabbert

Qualified Financial Accountant with 12+ years’ experience across family offices,
private equity, treasury, and auditing. I specialise in building finance
operations that are accurate, controlled, audit-ready, and decision-focused.

This GitHub showcases how I run a finance function in practice — not just
models, but end-to-end processes, controls, and governance.
